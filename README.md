### Projct Idea

The project is dedicated to delivering a robust API for image management, introducing three pivotal entities: Image, Thumbnail (automatically generated from the original image), and ImagePack, a compact grouping mechanism for related images. The Image entity acts as the fundamental representation of visual content, accompanied by its Thumbnail counterpart, optimized for efficient retrieval. The addition of ImagePack facilitates organized storage and retrieval of similar images, enhancing the overall management capabilities of the API. By combining these entities, the project aims to provide a versatile and user-friendly solution for developers to seamlessly manage, organize, and retrieve images within their applications or systems.

<b>Features:</b>
- Image management
- ImagePack management
- Thumbnail management
- Image processing into thumbnail

### Project Aim

The project's primary objective is to gain a fundamental understanding of Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA) within the context of C#. VSA is a software development approach that emphasizes the creation of complete, end-to-end slices of functionality across all layers of an application. By implementing VSA in C#, the goal is to enhance modularity, maintainability, and scalability, ultimately allowing for the efficient development of fully functional vertical slices that encapsulate specific features or components of the application. This approach facilitates iterative development and enables teams to deliver tangible and demonstrable results at each stage of the development process.

Project secondary goal is to get familiar with usefull nuget packages like MediatR and SignalR.

Project aim is not to create personal accounts.
